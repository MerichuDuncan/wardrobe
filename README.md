# wardrobe
Our 7th week project that is due &lt;=930AM, Monday.
My wardrobe is a website designed to display different clothing options to wear depending on the circumstances.
The website is based off my warbrobe, and is a great way to design outfits bases on tops, bottoms, accessoroes.
To use the website, simply go to it and then select the appropriate circumstances that apply to you.
